# Customer Segmentation through Data Clustering

This Jupyter Notebook focuses on the clustering of customer data for segmentation purposes. The code is available in the notebook, which can be accessed [here](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Rajora0/CLUSTER_SEG_CLIENT/blob/main/Clusteriza%C3%A7%C3%A3o_de_dados_segmenta%C3%A7%C3%A3o_de_clientes.ipynb).

## Loading and Preprocessing Data

The initial steps involve mounting Google Drive to access the dataset and performing ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) operations. The dataset used is available [here](https://github.com/smalvar/Client-Segmentation/blob/master/BancoDeDados.zip?raw=true).

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Exploratory analysis is performed to understand the dataset's characteristics, including its shape, information, and unique values. Visualizations are used to analyze customer locations, payment types, and other relevant factors.

## RFV Analysis

The Recency, Frequency, and Value (RFV) analysis is conducted to derive insights from customer transaction data. The Recency is calculated based on the time of the last purchase, while Frequency represents the number of transactions. Value corresponds to the total purchase amount.

## Recency Clustering

The K-means clustering algorithm is applied to cluster customers based on Recency. The Elbow Method and Silhouette Score are used to determine the optimal number of clusters.

## Frequency Clustering

Similar to Recency, Frequency is also clustered using the K-means algorithm. The resulting clusters represent different customer segments based on transaction frequency.

## Value Clustering

Value, representing the total purchase amount, is clustered using the K-means algorithm. This step aims to identify customer segments based on their spending behavior.

## Creating a Score

A composite score is generated by combining Recency, Frequency, and Value clusters. This score is used to categorize customers into different segments: Inactive, Business, Master, and Premium.

## Analyzing Features and Visualizing Segments

Scatterplots are used to visualize how different customer segments are distributed based on Recency, Frequency, and Value. The created segments are further analyzed to understand the distribution of customers across the segments.

## Exporting the Results

The final segmented dataset, including customer IDs, Recency, Frequency, Value, and assigned segments, is exported to a CSV file for further analysis and business decision-making.

This notebook provides a comprehensive approach to segmenting customers based on their transaction behavior, allowing businesses to tailor their strategies and marketing efforts for different customer segments.
